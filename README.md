# hello-world
First repository

Hello everyone!

It is a pleasure to finally join the git repository family. I am a student at Hanyang University, a prestige engineering
school located at the heart of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.

I will be uploading new projects in an on and off basis, including school projects, simple functions, etc.

I hope you guys enjoy my page!
